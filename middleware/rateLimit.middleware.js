/**
 * Reusable rate limiters.
 *
 * Each export is an Express middleware created with `express-rate-limit`.
 * They are kept here (rather than next to the route) so different route
 * groups can share consistent windows/limits and so the Redis-backed store
 * can be wired into a single place.
 *
 * Horizontal scalability.
 *   When `REDIS_URL` is set, every limiter swaps its in-memory store for
 *   a Redis-backed `rate-limit-redis` store so multiple API instances
 *   share one bucket per (limiter, key) pair. Without that, each instance
 *   keeps its own counter and effectively multiplies the cap by the
 *   replica count — which silently nullifies the limit at scale.
 *
 *   The fallback to the in-memory store is automatic when no Redis is
 *   configured, so local dev and single-instance prod stay zero-config.
 *   Call sites never see the difference.
 *
 * The full limiter matrix:
 *
 *   | Limiter            | Window | Max | Routes                                  |
 *   |--------------------|--------|-----|-----------------------------------------|
 *   | apiLimiter         | 15 min | 300 | global API (mounted in `index.js`)      |
 *   | authLimiter        | 15 min |  10 | `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register` |
 *   | passwordLimiter    | 15 min |   5 | `PATCH /api/auth/me/password`,          |
 *   |                    |        |     | `DELETE /api/auth/me`                    |
 *   | uploadLimiter      | 10 min |  20 | `/api/upload/*`                         |
 *   | quizSubmitLimiter  | 10 min |  30 | `POST /api/quizzes/:id/submit`          |
 *   | adminLimiter       | 10 min | 100 | `/api/admin/*`                          |
 *   | enrollLimiter      | 10 min |  30 | `POST /api/courses/:id/enroll`          |
 *   | verifyEmailLimiter | 15 min |   5 | `/api/auth/verify-email/*`              |
 *   | forgotPasswordL.   |  1 hr  |   3 | `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`        |
 *   | resetPasswordL.    | 15 min |   5 | `POST /api/auth/reset-password/:token`  |
 *   | refreshLimiter     |  1 min |  30 | `POST /api/auth/refresh`                |
 *
 * SECURITY NOTES:
 *   - Limits are per-IP using the trust-proxy aware `req.ip` lookup, except
 *     where the limiter sits AFTER `protect` and can key off `req.user._id`.
 *   - `standardHeaders: 'draft-7'` exposes RateLimit-* headers so clients
 *     can show retry hints; legacy `X-RateLimit-*` headers are disabled.
 *   - The `authLimiter` keys by IP+email so a single attacker can't lock
 *     out a victim by burning the bucket on their behalf — and so a single
 *     IP can still be probed across many emails (but with the global IP
 *     bucket capping the overall blast radius via `apiLimiter`).
 *   - The `passwordLimiter` ALWAYS sees an authenticated user (it sits
 *     after `protect`), so we key by user id with an IP fallback.
 *   - Upload limiter is intentionally tighter than the global API limiter
 *     because each upload consumes bandwidth and Cloudinary quota.
 *   - The Redis store keys are namespaced per-limiter (`rl:<name>:<key>`)
 *     so a `FLUSHDB` accident or a cross-prefix collision can't drain
 *     unrelated buckets together.
