/**
 * Quiz controller — both the instructor-facing CRUD for the quiz
 * attached to a single lesson AND the student-facing read /
 * submission surface.
 *
 * The two surfaces share a controller file (cohesion: they all touch
 * the same models), but they MUST be wired through DIFFERENT routers.
 * The instructor router (`quiz.routes.js`) installs
 * `protect + instructorOrAdmin` for every handler; the student router
 * (`quiz.student.routes.js`) installs `protect` only and per-route
 * enrollment checks. Mixing the two surfaces on a single router would
 * either lock students out (`instructorOrAdmin` gate) or accidentally
 * expose authoring views to learners.
 *
 * INSTRUCTOR mutations in this file:
 *
 *  - Re-resolve the parent `Lesson` and its owning `Course`, then
 *    assert the requester owns the course (or is an admin). Quiz ids
 *    alone are NOT a permission token. Failures are intentionally
 *    surfaced as 404 (never 403) to deny the id-space enumeration
 *    vector — same policy as `section.controller.js` and
 *    `lesson.controller.js`.
 *
 *  - Apply the documented mass-assignment whitelist
 *    (`title, description, passingScore, timeLimitSeconds, questions`).
 *    `lessonId`, `courseId`, and the timestamps are server-controlled
 *    and can NEVER flow in via the request body — `lessonId` is taken
 *    from the URL param, `courseId` is denormalized off the parent
 *    Lesson document.
 *
 *  - Treat `questions` as a full replacement on update. The model
 *    requires 1–50 questions per quiz; partial / sparse arrays are
 *    not supported and would corrupt the answer key.
 *
 * STUDENT reads / writes in this file:
 *
 *  - Always assert an `Enrollment` exists for `(req.user._id, quiz.
 *    courseId)` before returning ANY quiz data, even the sanitized
 *    student view. Enrollment is the gating capability — JWT alone
 *    is not enough to pull a quiz that belongs to a course the user
 *    has not paid / signed up for.
 *
 *  - NEVER serve `correctIndex` or `explanation` to the learner
 *    BEFORE submission. The student detail endpoint goes through
 *    `quiz.toStudentView()` which strips both fields. Per-question
 *    feedback is only emitted in the response of `submitQuiz`,
 *    AFTER the answers are persisted.
 *
 *  - Defer scoring to the QuizAttempt model's `pre('validate')` hook
 *    — that hook re-reads the canonical Quiz from the database and
 *    recomputes `score / correctCount / passed`, so any value a
 *    forged client puts in the body is silently overwritten. The
 *    controller's job is to validate shape, attach the authenticated
 *    user, and translate hook-thrown errors into operational HTTP
 *    failures.
 *
 * Counter / cross-document consistency (`Lesson.hasQuiz` flips on
 * insert and delete) is maintained by the schema-level hooks on the
 * Quiz model — the controller never writes that flag by hand.
