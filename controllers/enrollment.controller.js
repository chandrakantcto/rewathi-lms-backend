/**
 * Enrollment controller — student-facing join between a `User` and a
 * `Course`. Handles enroll / list / detail / unenroll.
 *
 * Security guarantees enforced here:
 *  - `userId` and `courseId` are ALWAYS derived from the authenticated
 *    session and the URL params — never from the request body. The
 *    Enrollment schema also rejects writes that try to set them via
 *    mass-assignment, but we never give the client that opportunity in
 *    the first place.
 *  - Duplicate enrollment is prevented by the compound unique index
 *    `{ userId, courseId }` on the schema. We attempt the insert and
 *    translate the inevitable `E11000` into a friendly 409 — this is
 *    the only race-safe pattern (a "find then create" pre-check would
 *    still let two concurrent requests slip through).
 *  - Only `published` courses can be enrolled in. Drafts, pending,
 *    rejected, and archived courses all return 400 — the same status
 *    rule that hides them from the public catalog.
 *  - Instructors cannot enroll in their own course (would inflate the
 *    `enrollmentCount` counter and skew analytics). Returns 400.
 *  - Unenroll cascades: the matching `QuizAttempt` documents for the
 *    same (userId, courseId) pair are removed so a re-enrollment
 *    starts on a clean slate. The Enrollment document's
 *    `findOneAndDelete` post-hook then decrements
 *    `Course.enrollmentCount`.

 * cannot be trusted with:

 *  1. The learner is enrolled (no ghost certificates for visitors who

 *  2. The course is fully complete (`progressPercent === 100`). The

 *     canonical lesson list, so this check is race-safe even if the
 *     instructor adds new lessons between the user's last completion
 *     and this request.
 *  3. The first issuance stamp (`certificateIssuedAt`) is recorded
 *     atomically and never moves backwards. Re-requests are idempotent
 *     and return the original timestamp so a downloaded certificate's
 *     "issued on" date stays stable across browsers and devices.
